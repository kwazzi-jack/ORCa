# **O**n-line **R**adio Interferometric **Ca**libration (ORCa)
A research prototype calibration suite for real-time or "online" calibration of radio interferometric data is called "On-line Radio interferometric Calibration" (ORCa). The suite is divided into an `ORCa-engine` (written in Rust) that performs computations and an `ORCa-UI` (written in Python) that is the user interface.
