# ORCa
A research prototype calibration suite for real-time or "online" calibration of radio interferometric data is called "**O**n-line **R**adio interferometric **Ca**libration" (ORCa). The suite is divided into an `ORCa-engine` (written in Rust) that performs computations and an `ORCa-UI` (written in Python) that is the user interface.
