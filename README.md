# ORCa
A research prototype calibration suite for real-time or "on-line" calibration of radio interferometric data, called "On-line Radio interferometric Calibration" (ORCa). The suite is divided into an 'ORCa-engine' (written in Rust) that performs computations, and an 'ORCa-UI' (written in Python) that is the user interface.
